- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Navigation** for navigation
- **Supabase** for backend services
- **Expo Vector Icons** for icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the mobile directory:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Update `app.json` with your Supabase URL and anon key
   - Or create a `.env` file with:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

### Running the App

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Run on specific platforms:
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # Android
   npm run android
   
   # Web
   npm run web
   ```

## Building for Production

1. Configure app.json with production settings
2. Build for specific platforms:
   ```bash
   # iOS
   expo build:ios
   
   # Android
   expo build:android
   ```

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code patterns
2. Use TypeScript for all new code
3. Follow the Redux patterns established in the web app
4. Test on both iOS and Android platforms
